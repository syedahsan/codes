/* 
 Given M busy-time slots of N people, You need to print all the available time slots when all the N people can schedule a meeting for a duration of K minutes.
Event time will be of form HH MM ( where 0 <= HH <= 23 and 0 <= MM <= 59 ), K will be in the form minutes.
 
Input Format:
 
M K [ M number of busy time slots , K is the duration in minutes ]
Followed by M lines with 4 numbers on each line.
Each line will be of form StartHH StartMM EndHH EndMM  [ Example 9Am-11Am time slot will be given as 9 00 11 00 ]
An event time slot is of form [Start Time, End Time ) . Which means it inclusive at start time but doesnâ€™t include the end time. 
So an event of form 10 00  11 00 => implies that the meeting start at 10:00 and ends at 11:00, so another meeting can start at 11:00.
 
Sample Input:
5 120
16 00 17 00
10 30 14 30
20 45 22 15
10 00 13 15
09 00 11 00
 
Sample Output:
00 00 09 00
17 00 20 45
 
Sample Input:
8 60
08 00 10 15
22 00 23 15
17 00 19 00
07 00 09 45
09 00 13 00
16 00 17 45
12 00 13 30
11 30 12 30
 
Sample Output:
00 00 07 00
13 30 16 00
19 00 22 00
 
Constraints :
1 <= M <= 100
 
Note: 24 00 has to be presented as 00 00.
