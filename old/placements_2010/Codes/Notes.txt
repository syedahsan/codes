C

1) Declaring integer in C with only 3-bits
	
	works only with struct and int

	struct temp
	{
		int a:3;
		// declare a with 3 bits space and rest 32-3 will be wasted since it is in struct
		// also b will be 
		int a:3, b:5;
		// will declare a with 3 bits and b with 5 bits and rest 32-(3+5) will be wasted

	}

C++

2) placement "new" constructer in C++
